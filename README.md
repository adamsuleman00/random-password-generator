# random-password-generator

Here's a simple Python program that generates a random password based on user input

This code prompts the user to enter a string and password length, then generates a random password of the specified length by selecting characters from the string module's ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation. The user-entered string is then added to the beginning of the password.

The code also includes a main function and if __name__ == '__main__': block, which is a common structure for Python scripts. This allows the script to be run directly, but also allows the functions to be imported and used in other code if needed.
